## StatsBomb open data (primary source for the full-field analysis — highest confidence)

`data/statsbomb_team_stats_2022.csv` is aggregated directly from StatsBomb's free open
event data (all 64 competitive matches of the 2022 World Cup — Group Stage + knockouts, no
friendlies). Penalty shootouts (period 5) are excluded, so counts reflect penalties awarded
in play. Independently reproduces the headline facts: **total penalties = 23; Argentina = 5
for / 2 against in 7 games.**

- StatsBomb open-data: https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data (competition_id 43, season_id
  106 = FIFA World Cup 2022)
- Per-team fields derived: non-penalty shots, non-penalty xG, penalties for/against, fouls
  won/committed, yellow/red cards.

**Competitive tournaments since 2022 (the conspiracy window):**
- `data/statsbomb_team_stats_copa2024.csv` — Copa America 2024 (competition 223, season 282),
  all 32 matches, from StatsBomb open data. **Argentina 2024: 1 penalty for, 1 against, 6
  games — 1.07x the field per-game rate, ranked 4th of 16. They won the tournament.**

  since 2022 (WC 2022 + Copa America 2024 from StatsBomb; 2026 WC provisional). Competitive
  matches only — no friendlies/exhibitions (these are tournament event-data feeds).

**Historical StatsBomb seasons (for the structural-break test):**
- `data/statsbomb_team_stats_2018.csv` — 2018 World Cup (season_id 3), all 64 matches. Confirms
  the reported 29 total penalties. **Argentina 2018: 1 penalty for, 2 against, 4 games — 1.10x
  the field per-game rate, ranked 19th of 32.**

  2022 rows are StatsBomb (high confidence); 2010/2014 are approximate (web, low confidence);
  2026 is provisional. 1986 (season_id 54) open data is only partial (3 matches) and is not used.
