# Does Argentina Get Favorable Treatment From World Cup Referees?

A small, reproducible data project testing a popular claim: that Argentina is favored
by referees — especially on penalty kicks — at the FIFA World Cup. Focus: **2022 (Qatar,
complete)** and **2026 (ongoing, provisional data)**.

## Design

**Subject:** Argentina in 2022 + 2026. **Control:** the rest of World Cup history.
The question is how extreme Argentina's penalty haul is against that historical baseline.

## TL;DR

- **All-time record:** Argentina's **5 penalties in 2022 is the most ever awarded to a
  single team in one World Cup** — no team in ~90 years had exceeded 4 (Netherlands 1978,
  Portugal 1966). That's the 100th percentile of the whole historical distribution.
- **Within 2022:** those 5 were **21.7% of the 23 penalties in the entire tournament** —
  to one of 32 teams.
- **Rate test vs the VAR-era baseline (0.20 penalties/team/match):**
  - 2022 → 3.5× expected, **p = 0.015** (significant)
  - 2026 (provisional) → 2.0× expected, p = 0.27 (not significant; only 5 games)
  - **2022 + 2026 pooled → 2.9× expected, p = 0.013** (significant)
- **It's not just "they attack more":** France — the other finalist, same 7 games — took
  **more shots (92 vs 76)** for **equal xG (11.5 vs 11.8)** yet got **2.5× fewer penalties.**
  Per 100 shots, Argentina drew **3× as many** as an equally elite side.
- **Placebo check passes:** the same outlier test flags Argentina (p = 0.015) but **not**
  France (p = 0.42) — the signal is Argentina-specific, not "any good team."
- **The 2026 twist:** Argentina were awarded ≥2 penalties again — but **Messi missed both**,
  the first player ever to miss two in a single World Cup. "Gets the calls" ≠ "always benefits."
- **Counter-evidence / nuance (2022):** the same refs booked them **16 times in 7 games**,
  put them in the most-carded match in World Cup history, and they were *not* even the most
  shot-happy team. Favored on **penalties specifically** — not "teacher's pet" across the board.

This repo is built to be **credible under scrutiny**, not to win an argument. The
counter-evidence is reported alongside the headline, because on LinkedIn the comment
section will find it anyway. **Significance is not intent** — an outlier this size can also
come from a possession-heavy side that lives in the opponent's box.

## Reproduce

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/analyze.py               # 2022 single-tournament deep-dive
python src/baseline_comparison.py   # Argentina (2022+2026) vs World Cup history
python src/exposure_and_scorecard.py # exposure model + scorecard + placebo control
```

Outputs regenerate the `reports/*.md` findings files and charts in `figures/`.

## A note on honesty

The point of the project was to test a claim, not to launder a conclusion. The 2022
penalty finding is real and holds up. The framing throughout is deliberately careful:
an outlier is evidence worth discussing, not proof of intent. See
[`reports/METHODOLOGY.md`](reports/METHODOLOGY.md) for the caveats.

**2026 data is provisional** — collected from live reporting while the tournament is
ongoing and should be re-verified before publication.
