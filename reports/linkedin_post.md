Three versions at different heat levels. All are defensible — none require hiding data.
Pick one, drop in a chart from `figures/`, and edit the voice to sound like you.

## Version A — the punchy one (recommended)

Everyone jokes that Argentina gets "help" from referees at the World Cup.

So I actually ran the numbers. 📊

At the 2022 World Cup, **23 penalties were awarded across the whole tournament.
Argentina got 5 of them.**

That's **21.7% of every penalty — awarded to 1 of 32 teams.**

"But they played 7 games, they reached the final." Fair. So I adjusted for it. At the
tournament's average penalty rate, a 7-game team should expect ~1.3 penalties. Argentina
got 5 — about **4× expectation.** A Poisson test lands at **p ≈ 0.009.** Statistically,
that's a genuine outlier, not a vibe.

Now the part most "FIFA loves Argentina" posts leave out:

The same referees showed Argentina **16 yellow cards in 7 games** and put them in the
most-carded match in World Cup history. They conceded 2 penalties in the final. A team
that's being *protected* doesn't lead the tournament in bookings.

So what's the honest takeaway? The penalty count is a **real statistical anomaly worth
talking about** — but "anomaly" isn't the same as "conspiracy." Elite attacking teams
that live in the opponent's box draw penalties. The data flags something; it doesn't
prove intent.

That nuance is the whole point. Outlier: yes. Smoking gun: not from this alone.

## Version B — the analyst's framing (most credible, least clickbait)

A short lesson in why "significant" and "proven" aren't the same word — using the
Argentina refereeing conspiracy as the example.

The claim: World Cup referees favor Argentina.
The most-cited evidence: they were awarded **5 of 23 penalties** at Qatar 2022 (21.7%).

I tested it properly:
• Baseline penalty rate: 0.18 per team per match
• Argentina's expected haul over 7 games: ~1.3
• Actual: 5 → ~4× expected, Poisson p ≈ 0.009 ✅ significant

Case closed? No — and here's the discipline that separates analysis from a hot take:

1️⃣ **Selection bias.** I picked the team *because* it looked extreme. With 32 teams,
someone tops the table by luck. That inflates significance.
2️⃣ **Confounding.** Penalties are earned. Possession-dominant teams draw box fouls.
3️⃣ **Counter-evidence.** 16 yellow cards in 7 games; 2 penalties conceded. Not
"protected."

The result I'll actually defend: Argentina's penalty count was a **real outlier** —
and that's genuinely interesting — but a single-team, small-sample test can't prove
favoritism. Anyone selling you certainty here is selling.

## Version D — the two-tournament / historical-record angle (strongest evidence)

I tested the "referees favor Argentina" theory the right way: **Argentina in 2022 + 2026 as
the subject, all of World Cup history as the control.** Here's what held up. 🧵

**1. They hold the all-time record.** Argentina were awarded **5 penalties at the 2022 World
Cup — the most EVER given to one team in a single tournament.** In ~90 years, no team had ever
topped 4. That's not "high." That's the 100th percentile of every team in World Cup history.

**2. It's statistically real.** Against the VAR-era baseline (~0.2 penalties/team/game),
Argentina's 2022 haul is **3.5× expected, p = 0.015.** Not a coincidence.

**3. It didn't stop in 2026.** They've already drawn ≥2 penalties in 5 games — ~2× the baseline
again. On its own the 2026 sample is too small to be significant (p = 0.27), but **pool both
tournaments and it holds: 2.9× expected, p = 0.013.**

Now the part that keeps me honest — and makes the story better:

**In 2026, Messi MISSED both penalties** — the first player ever to miss two in a single World
Cup. So "Argentina gets the calls" looks real. But "Argentina always benefits"? The data says
no. And in 2022 the same refs booked them 16 times in 7 games — the most-carded team in the
tournament.

My actual conclusion: the penalty pattern is a **genuine statistical anomaly** worth talking
about. But significance ≠ intent — elite, possession-heavy teams that attack the box draw
penalties. The data flags something real. It doesn't prove a conspiracy. Anyone claiming
certainty in either direction is overselling.

## Version E — the France comparison (the single most convincing angle)

"Argentina got the most penalties because they attacked the most." I hear this every time. So
I checked it against the one team that kills the argument: **France — the other 2022 finalist.**

Same tournament. Same 7 games. Here's the tale of the tape:

• Shots: France **92**, Argentina **76** → *France attacked MORE*
• xG (chance quality): France **11.5**, Argentina **11.8** → *basically identical*
• Penalties awarded: France **2**, Argentina **5**

Per 100 shots, **Argentina drew 3× the penalties of a team that shot more often than they did.**

Then the placebo test: I ran the same "is this a statistical outlier?" check on both. Argentina
trips it hard (p = 0.015). **France doesn't (p = 0.42).** Same elite level, same run to the final
— the alarm only goes off for one of them. So "it's just what good teams get" doesn't hold.

And to stay honest: this is narrow. The same refs booked Argentina **16 times in 7 games** — the
most-carded team, in the most-carded match in World Cup history. They weren't handed *everything*.
They were handed **penalties**, specifically, at a rate no attacking or historical baseline explains.

Outlier? Clearly. Proof of a conspiracy? No — data can't read minds. But "they just attacked more"
is now officially dead. 📉

## Version C — the one-liner hook (for the top of the post)

> Argentina won 21.7% of ALL the penalties at the 2022 World Cup — 5 of 23, as 1 of 32
> teams. I ran the stats on whether that's suspicious or just what winning looks like. 🧵

### Notes before you post
- Swap `[repo link]` for the GitHub URL once it's live.
- Attach `figures/penalty_share.png` or `figures/observed_vs_expected.png`.
- If you cite the 2026 examples, label them clearly as *ongoing / provisional* — the
  tournament isn't finished and the numbers aren't final.
- Re-verify the raw counts against `data/SOURCES.md` before publishing. Your credibility
  is the product.
